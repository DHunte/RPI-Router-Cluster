# About
This project aims to create a minimal viable router on raspbian (RPI).

# Setup
ETH1 is used for a direct active router connection.
ETH0 should be used as a branching connection (to all other network devices such as a switch or a single computer).

## Usage
Run the make command to execute all tasks. make ROUTER can be used to setup only the interfaces alternatively make DNS to setup coredns.

## Coredns
Coredns is used to provide an upstream dns server as well as allow custom entries to be added via the Corefile generated by make.
